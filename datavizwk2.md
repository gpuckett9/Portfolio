# General Government Debt Visualized Using GDP
The following visualization endeavors to show a single variable and the changes it sees over time in individual areas. Rather than providing a viewer with a complicated line chart that could easily become overwhelming due to the sheer number of lines, a grid of line charts opens the possibility of easy comparison. This way, a viewer doesn't have to spend unnecessary time trying to follow and decipher lines. 

Please note that the data seen in the bar chart above is only a small fraction of the data shown below. The two charts are working to tell two different stories - one about the debt ratio in a single year, the other about changes over time - and are therefore displayed in different ways.
