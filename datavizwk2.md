# General Government Debt Visualized Using GDP
The following visualization endeavors to show a single variable and the changes it sees over time in individual areas. Rather than providing a viewer with a complicated line chart that could easily become overwhelming due to the sheer number of lines, a grid of line charts opens the possibility of easy comparison. This way, a viewer doesn't have to spend unnecessary time trying to follow and decipher lines. 

Please note that the data seen in the bar chart above is only a small fraction of the data shown below. The two charts are working to tell two different stories - one about the debt ratio in a single year, the other about changes over time - and are therefore displayed in different ways.

# Comparing How Data is Visualized
These two charts, while they use the same data. tell dramatically different stories. The first focuses on year over year comparisons between individual countries and easily highlights where the data recording begins and ends. The second looks at the data set as a whole, comparing the total debt ratios per global region. Part of the reason I chose to go with the stacked bar chart was because I was curious how you might be able to compare the data from a different lens, rather than limiting the viewer at the country level. Additionally, as someone who doesn't really understand everything behind the concept of debt-to-GDP ratio, I wanted to play around with the data to find more pathways for understanding. 

**Similarities**
- Compare data based on the same variable
- Year over year timeline

**Differences**
- Country by country versus Global regions
- Use of or need for color schemes to distinguish

Looking at the differences between the charts, I'm confident in saying that they cater to different audiences who each possess different levels of knowledge. The set of line charts caters more to an audience that has greater understanding of the implications of the debt-to-GDP ratio, whereas the stacked bars highlight where the global debt is centered.
