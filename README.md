# About Me
Hi there! My name is Grace (she/her/hers) and I'm currently a second-year Master of Arts Management student here at CMU's Heinz College. My background is based heavily in the performing arts and throughout most of my studies, I've worked to find ways through which the arts can be talked about, in all its complexity, by professionals and laypersons alike. It is imperative for the performing arts to understand how to consider data and information through the eyes of their audiences, yet the ability to do so seems to elude many arts organizations, especially within the genre of dance, theatre, and opera. With aging audiences, ensuring the art we present is relevant has become increasingly important and one way to do that is through data transparency.

# What I Hope To Learn
One reason I'm taking this course is to develop a better tool kit for implementing the use of data by performing arts institutions to increase impact across the entire industry. A nod to the incredible work the entertainment sphere has done in utilizing data to increase buy-in, one of my goals is to show the performing arts that we can use data to our benefit and we don't have to be afraid of adding it into our management (and marketing) processes. Though our focus is mission-based, we still have to get buy-in from those we work with and improving the quality of data visualization to match the current times is something we should be investing in.

In addition to understanding how data visualization might help the performing arts industry as a whole, I'm also interested in learning how to view visuals as another form of language. The arts often talk about how what we do - movement, painting, composing, performing - are various forms of language that have the ability to communicate emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc. By taking this course, I want to add data visualization to the languages I can use to communicate through when interacting with organizational audiences, colleagues, foundations and board members. As an industry, the performing arts has a long way to go in terms of change and I hope to be able to use the data that is at our fingertips (but rarely used) to help make ethical and equitable decisions wherever possible while pushing artistic exploration in my career following graduation.
