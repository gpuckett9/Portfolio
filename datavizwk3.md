# Critique by Re-Design

The chart I chose for this exercise, shown below, is one that is serviceable to its audience, but makes assumptions about how arts managers would prefer to view and understand the data, as well as their capability. It's interactivity makes for an engaging chart, but the necessity of clicking back and forth between states makes comparison difficult and tedious. Lacking a clear story outside of individual state metrics, the chart below from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) offers only the most basic understanding of the data. For the arts, good data visualizations are hard to come by, as the current mentality in the industry is that data has no role - though that is changing. This chart presented a wonderful opportunity to showcase how data can effectively be used to tell an actionable story for the arts, while still utilizing elements of simplicity for clarity.

# My Re-Design for Arts Managers

To redesign the NEA's chart, I first thought about what kind of story I wanted to be able to tell with the data. Did I want the audience to focus on one variable or two? Should they be considering state level metrics or employment? Once I had narrowed down my focus to showing **how** the arts impact state economies as a whole, I then moved to considering the visual itself. Not wanting to repeat the assumptions made by the original chart, my goal was to find a way to showcase multiple data variables without over complicating things. Keeping this in mind, I wireframed several different chart types - bar charts, geographic density maps, scatter plots, multiple chart frames, etc. Each of these were chart types that provided me with the ability to compare and contrast data state by state easily and organize it in ways that made visual sense. Following my initial sketch session, I went back through and tried to view each wireframe from an alternative perspective. My hope was to identify the best candidates, which I could then refine further to share with my peers to get feedback. 

As a masters student studying arts management, many of the peers I turn to are those also looking to enter the industry and make change for the better. I ended up sharing two potential options: a geographic density map showcasing one variable and a bubble chart that showcased three variables. The feedback I got helped me to really dial in on the story I wanted to tell with my data visualization and led me to choose the bubble map. My reasoning for selecting this particular type, as well as the variables themselves, was to show how data gathered on the arts could be pieced together to prove how impactful it can be on economic livelihood. With a data visualization like this at hand, arts managers and funders might better be able to advocate for additional funding, prevent programming from being de-funded, and show the value of having a healthy arts environment as an integral part of state (or national) economies.
