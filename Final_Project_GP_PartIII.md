# The Final Data Story

Following the completion of Part II, my project finally found a cohesive look and flow, thanks to wonderful feedback gained through my user research and in-class ctirique sessions. One of the changes I made for the final version was re-evaluating the order of some of my data visualizations and where viewers would come across them in relation to the overall outline and included text. The parliment seat chart had originally been used as part of the call to action, highlighting that positive change is happening for women in dance leadership, even if it was slow occurring. However, after user research indicated it's placement would likely be stronger if shown sooner, I decided it would be better off placing emphasis about how few women are in leadership, depsite the opposite trend in overall employment. 

Another change I made was resketching charts that users had trouble understanding, particularly the one that highlighted diparities in pay. Initially, I went with a treemap style chart in an attempt to show the difference in proportion of pay. However, further conversation revealed that focusing on the data as acutal numbers rather than making a jump to visual proportions would be a better approach. As a result, that chart was changed to a line chart, equivalent to $1.00, with data points indicating how women in the industry were paid, with a workforce average included for comparison. Not only did this increase clarity, changing the chart type provided an opportunity to increase the number of data points included without sacrificing overall clarity. Along with some resketches, I reevaluated the overall color scheme and worked to use the color gray as my friend, rather than going overboard with colors, as well as finding a way to link all of the charts together by using a monochromatic-esque theme. This way I could show all of the data, but only highlight what I wanted viewers to really pay attention to. 

User research also revealed that chart titles were, as a whole, not as clear as they could be. In some places they initially referred to aspects not discussed later on, even though they were accurate in relation to the data itself. This led me to rethink and rework the chart titles on nearly every graph, so as to tie into the overall story much better, while still staying true to what the data was saying. Changing titles was also tied into efforts of balancing text with visuals and helping the charts speak for themselves. By clarifying the chart titles, I was able to refine what text should and shouldn't be included, as well as finalize a clear layout that was visually pleasing. 

Finally, I made sure to differentiate my target audience in my call to action to clarify that this is an issue for women and men in the industry alike. The need to define the topic as an important one for all industry employees, regardless of who they are, was brought up in my user research and I wanted to honor that. Not to mention, clearly identifying who might be interested in taking specific actions helped me better understand my own audience. Sometimes being so close to the topic at hand makes it harder to reach clarity, so I appreciated any feedback that helped highlight blindspots and move the project forward.
