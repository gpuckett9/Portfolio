**The Final Data Story**

Following the completion of Part II, my project finally found a cohesive look and flow, thanks to wonderful feedback gained through my user research and in-class ctirique sessions. One of the changes I made for the final version was re-evaluating the order of some of my data visualizations and where viewers would come across them in relation to the overall outline and included text. The parliment seat chart had originally been used as part of the call to action, highlighting that positive change is happening for women in dance leadership, even if it was slow occurring. However, after user research indicated it's placement would likely be stronger if shown sooner, I decided it would be better off placing emphasis about how few women are in leadership, depsite the opposite trend in overall employment. Another change I made was resketching charts that users had trouble understanding, particularly the one that highlighted diparities in pay. Initially, I went with a treemap (?) style chart in an attempt to show the difference in proportion of pay. However, further conversation revealed that focusing on the data as acutal numbers rather than making a jump to visual proportions would be a better approach. As a result, that chart was changed to a line chart, equivalent to $1.00, with data points indicating how women in the industry were paid, with a workforce average included for comparison. Not only did this increase clarity, changing the chart type provided an opportunity to increase the number of data points included without sacrificing overall clarity.
