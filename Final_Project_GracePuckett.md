# My Final Project

# Project Outline
My project will be looking at the gender and pay disparities found in the leadership roles of the dance industry, advocating for more support and mentorship for women who seek to fill those positions. 

**Project Structure**

I see my project including the following touchpoints:
* Overall number of women in the dance industry vastly outweights that of men.
* Opportunities to find female mentors are nearly endless.
* Men, though the industry minority, hold the majority of leadership positions.
  * Women are also paid significantly less than their male counterparts in the same positions.
* Change is on the horizon! More women are now holding these positions.
* Call to Action: 
  * Support research being done to understand the gender and pay gap within the dance industry, and
  * Mentorship programs for women in the arts who want to be artistic and executive directors.
