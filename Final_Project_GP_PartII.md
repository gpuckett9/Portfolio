# Part II: User Research & Wireframing

# User Research
As part of developing this data story, I went through a process by which I identified:
- The target audience I hope to reach
- Figuring out how to get their feedback
- The questions I asked
- What my target audience said, and
- The changes I plan to make in the final product as a result

**Target Audience**

The target audience I'm hoping to reach with my story are arts managers who work in the dance industry, particularly those who may be, or may have been, professional dancers looking to move into leadership positions. After doing a bit of digging, I believe the age range of individuals I'm targeting is quite large, spanning from about 26 years old to 50 years old. The broad extent is due in part to the young average age at which many individuals start a dance career, versus the average age(s) of a company executive. Ideally, my story will speak to all individuals within that age range and will encourage them to support and advocate for more women to fill leadership roles over the next few years.

**How Do I Reach My Audience?**

When thinking about how to reach my target audience, I immediately thought of utilizing the connections I've developed the last few years as an aspiring arts manager myself. Additionally, I know that the dance industry is not the only arts field that struggles with equality for women, either in leadership roles or simply with representation. As a result, I felt that getting opinions from outside teh dance industry could open my eyes to any ideas/concepts/data that I may have unintentionally glossed over, being so close to the topic at hand. 

**Interview Questions**

Since my target audience and interviewees are all entrenched in the arts, I wanted to ask questions that would give me equal feedback on the industry response and whatever emotions elicited from the individual level. The goal is not to lead them to what I want to hear, but see my story from a different perspective and through new sets of eyes.

1. What is your initial reaction to the story being told?
2. Were there moments that struck you for any particular reason, positive or negative?
3. Do you feel like the story flows? Are there any moments that you might consider rearranging? Why?
4. Are there elements that you believe may be missing from the story or the data being shown?
5.
