# Part II: User Research & Wireframing

# User Research
As part of developing this data story, I went through a process by which I identified:
- The target audience I hope to reach
- Figuring out how to get their feedback
- The questions I asked
- What my target audience said, and
- The changes I plan to make in the final product as a result

**Target Audience**

The target audience I'm hoping to reach with my story are arts managers who work in the dance industry, particularly those who may be, or may have been, professional dancers looking to move into leadership positions. After doing a bit of digging, I believe the age range of individuals I'm targeting is quite large, spanning from about 26 years old to 50 years old. The broad extent is due in part to the young average age at which many individuals start a dance career, versus the average age(s) of a company executive. Ideally, my story will speak to all individuals within that age range and will encourage them to support and advocate for more women to fill leadership roles over the next few years.

**How Do I Reach My Audience?**

When thinking about how to reach my target audience, I immediately thought of utilizing the connections I've developed the last few years as an aspiring arts manager myself. Additionally, I know that the dance industry is not the only arts field that struggles with equality for women, either in leadership roles or simply with representation. As a result, I felt that getting opinions from outside teh dance industry could open my eyes to any ideas/concepts/data that I may have unintentionally glossed over, being so close to the topic at hand. 

**Interview Questions**

Since my target audience and interviewees are all entrenched in the arts, I wanted to ask questions that would give me equal feedback on the industry response and whatever emotions elicited from the individual level. The goal is not to lead them to what I want to hear, but see my story from a different perspective and through new sets of eyes.

1. What is your initial reaction to the story being told?
2. From your perspective, what do you think is the main point of the story?
3. Were there moments that struck you for any particular reason, positive or negative?
4. Do you feel like the story flows? Are there any moments that you might consider rearranging? Why?
5. Do you have any insights or comments that you'd like to share regarding the data visualizations currently included? 
6. Are there elements that you believe may be missing from the story or the data being shown?
7. Any additional comments, thoughts, insights, etc.?

**Interview Responses**

Following my user research, I found out that my interviewees felt overall the general flow of my story was clear despite a some areas needing some additional clarification. The topic itself generated obvious emotions, with all of the interviewees remarking how, in some form, the story elicited negative emotions. A a few of the emotiona-based comments were:

- "We need more women in dance leadership!! F$%* the gender wage gap!!"
- "The wage gap visualization made me mad..."
- "I think the transition from data women as dancers and choreographers to women in dance leadership is pretty stark / negative."

The areas my interviewees felt needed further clarification were ones where the titles of the visualizations needed to be re-worked and chart color schemes need to be made consistent. Some of the struggles my viewers may have had while reviewing could have been the result of not including much text in my wireframing. I included titles to assist with understanding my flow since I had no text, but without additional context, my viewers had to work harder to understand what I was trying to say. 

When I asked about my data visualizations, my interviewers had this to say:

- "I really love your Flourish election chart, I think it's an effective and engaging way to represent all of that data. I think the blue/grey bar chart in "The Problem" slide could be added in there; that one seems more fitting with the "there is change but we need more fuel to the fire" message since you can see the proportion of women in leadership already growing. I think the other two donut charts work well there, and there might be another way to visualize data that shows a snapshot of the problem for that slide."
- "The "Which leadership job did they hold?" viz is the least intuitive to me; my brain immediately looks at the large blocks of color in the viz itself, but then I'm already confused about what it means until I find the rather small legend above. Maybe make the legend bigger so my eyes go to it first?"
- "I might reconsider the format for the pay chart. It looks like a tree map (maybe it is . . . I don't know), and that causes it to register a little differently. I also assume you'll unify your color scheme at some point, but that I believe will help a lot -- coding women as one color consitently maybe."

From their comments, I believe I need to consider further where the best locations for my charts might actually be. I think the most of them are in the right spot, but I'd like to consider further if the dot chart and the bar chart should be flipped. I also want to reconsider the chart type for my viz that look at the wage gap and see if a different format might read better than the version I've currently got.

**Changes and Next Steps**- 

After getting feedback from my target audience, I plan on taking the following actions:

- Adding in appropriate text for the story's context
- Resketching vizualizations for charts my interviewees had trouble with
- Clarifying chart titles
- Work to balance text and data viz so the charts can speak for themselves
- Make the color scheme consistent
- Making sure all pertinent data is included
